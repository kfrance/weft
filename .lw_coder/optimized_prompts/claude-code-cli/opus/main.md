# Claude Code CLI Main Prompt (Sonnet)

I want you to implement a plan in the file plan.md. After implmenting it do the following in a loop that you continue until everything is work or you have looped 4 times.
1. Run the tests and make sure they all pass fixing any issues that come up
2. Run the code review auditor and the plan alignment agent in parallel. Fix any issues that come up from their feedback.
