New functionality (training data loading, DSPy prompt generation, candidate writing) is cleanly separated into dedicated modules. Existing modules like `prompt_loader.py`, `init_command.py`, and `cli.py` are appropriately extended rather than duplicated. No instances of duplicated logic, missed abstractions, or pattern inconsistencies were found.\n\n### Positive Examples of Good Reuse\n1. **prompt_loader.py extension (lines ~20-160)**:\n   - Added `_migrate_prompts_if_needed()` and `_get_prompts_base()` as targeted extensions to handle new `prompts/active/` structure.\n   - `load_current_prompts_for_training()` reuses existing file discovery patterns and adds dynamic subagent loading via `glob(\"*.md\")` \u2013 perfect reuse of Pathlib without reimplementing directory scanning.\n   - Falls back gracefully to old `optimized_prompts/` with one-time migration using `shutil.copytree()` \u2013 delegates to stdlib instead of custom copy logic.\n\n2. **cli.py integration (lines ~250-290)**:\n   - Follows exact pattern of other commands (lazy imports in `main()` dispatch: `from .train_command import run_train_command`).\n   - Parser setup mirrors `eval_parser` structure (e.g., `--model` with default).\n   - No duplication of argument validation or dispatch logic.\n\n3. **init_command.py migration (lines ~300-320, ~450-470)**:\n   - Updates `copy_optimized_prompts()` to new path (`prompts/active`), reuses existing `shutil.copytree()` and atomic staging.\n   - Detects customizations for both old/new paths via `detect_customizations()` extension.\n   - Cleanup of old `optimized_prompts/` is a clean addition without reimplementing directory ops.\n\n4. **train_command.py orchestration**:\n   - Reuses `find_repo_root()`, `load_training_batch()`, `load_current_prompts_for_training()`, `get_cache_dir()`.\n   - Parameter validation via new `_validate_parameters()` but follows patterns from other commands.\n   - Output formatting reuses logger patterns from `eval_command.py`.\n\n5. **DSPy integration in prompt_trainer.py**:\n   - Follows established DSPy pattern from codebase (e.g., `dspy.Signature`, `dspy.Predict`, OpenRouter LM config matching CLAUDE.md guidelines).\n   - No reimplementation of judge_executor logic \u2013 new `PromptTrainerSignature` is feature-specific.\n   - Token extraction `_extract_token_usage()` is minimal and new (no equivalent exists).\n\n6. **Tests**:\n   - Unit tests follow existing pytest patterns (e.g., `tmp_path` fixtures, `monkeypatch` for subprocess).\n   - Integration test `test_train_command_end_to_end()` uses real DSPy per CLAUDE.md (\"no mocks for DSPy\"), with caching.\n\n### No Reimplemented Functionality Found\n- **New modules** (`training_types.py`, `training_data_loader.py`, `prompt_trainer.py`, `candidate_writer.py`, `train_command.py`): All genuinely new abstractions for training workflow. No duplication of existing loaders (e.g., `plan_validator.py`), git utils, or DSPy patterns.\n- **Judge formatting** in `training_data_loader.py._format_judge_results()`: Simple new logic for concatenating JSON/MD files \u2013 no overlap with judge_executor output parsing.\n- **Candidate numbering/writing**: Custom regex/glob logic specific to `candidate-NNN/` \u2013 no existing equivalent.\n- **Directory migration**: Uses stdlib `shutil`/`Path.mkdir()` \u2013 no custom FS ops reimplemented.\n- **Git deletions** (optimized_prompts): Necessary for migration, not code duplication.\n\n### Recommendations for Further Reuse (Minor)\n- Consider extracting common DSPy LM config (OpenRouter, cache, reasoning) into a shared `dspy_utils.py` utility if more signatures are added (already good pattern adherence).\n- `candidate_writer.py` filename sanitization could reuse a general `safe_filename()` util if added later, but it's feature-specific and minimal.\n\nThis change demonstrates mature codebase stewardship: extends without duplication, preserves patterns, adds comprehensive tests (unit + real DSPy integration)."
